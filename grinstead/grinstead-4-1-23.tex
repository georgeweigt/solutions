\section*{23.}
You are given two urns and fifty balls. Half of the balls are white and half
are black. You are asked to distribute the balls in the urns with no restriction
placed on the number of either type in an urn. How should you distribute
the balls in the urns to maximize the probability of obtaining a white ball if
an urn is chosen at random and a ball drawn out at random? Justify your
answer.

It doesn't make any difference.
