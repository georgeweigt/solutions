\section*{27.}
In London, half of the days have some rain. The weather forecaster
is correct 2/3 of the time, i.e., the probability that it rains, given that she has
predicted rain, and the probability that it does not rain, given that she has
predicted that it won't rain, are both equal to 2/3. When rain is forecast,
Mr. Pickwick takes his umbrella. When rain is not forecast, he takes it with
probability 1/3. Find

\bigskip
\noindent
(a) the probability that Pickwick has no umbrella, given that it rains.

\bigskip
\noindent
Let $F$ be be the event that rain is forecast, $U$ be the event that
Mr. Pickwick takes his umbrella, and $R$ be the event that it
actually rains.
We have
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(R)&=&1/2\\
P(R\mid F)&=&2/3\\
P(R^c\mid F^c)&=&2/3
\end{eqnarray*}
Note that since the forecast is wrong 1/3 of the time we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(R^c\mid F)&=&1/3\\
P(R\mid F^c)&=&1/3
\end{eqnarray*}
Using total probablity we have
$$P(R)=P(R\mid F)P(F)+P(R\mid F^c)(1-P(F))$$
hence
$${1\over2}={2\over3}P(F)+{1\over3}(1-P(F))$$
Therefore
$$P(F)={1\over2}$$
The possible outcomes are

\bigskip
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
$F\cap U\cap R$ & $1/2\times1\times2/3=1/3$ & It rains.\\
$F\cap U\cap R^c$ & $1/2\times1\times1/3=1/6$\\
$F^c\cap U\cap R$ & $1/2\times1/3\times1/3=1/18$ & It rains.\\
$F^c\cap U\cap R^c$ & $1/2\times1/3\times2/3=1/9$\\
$F^c\cap U^c\cap R$ & $1/2\times2/3\times1/3=1/9$ & It rains, no umbrella\\
$F^c\cap U^c\cap R^c$ & $1/2\times2/3\times2/3=3/9$\\
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
\noindent
It follows that
$$P(U^c\mid R)={1/9\over1/3+1/18+1/9}={1/9\over1/2}=2/9$$
