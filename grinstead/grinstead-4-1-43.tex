\section*{43.}
The Yankees are playing the Dodgers in a world series. The Yankees win each
game with probability .6. What is the probability that the Yankees win the
series? (The series is won by the first team to win four games.)

\bigskip
\noindent
The choose function chooses which games are lost.
The series ends with a win so choose from the number of games played minus one.
$$p^4+{4\choose1}p^4(1-p)+{5\choose2}p^4(1-p)^2+{6\choose3}p^4(1-p)^3=0.7102$$
