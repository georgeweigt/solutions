\section*{29.}
A student is applying to Harvard and Dartmouth. He estimates that he has
a probability of .5 of being accepted at Dartmouth and .3 of being accepted
at Harvard. He further estimates the probability that he will be accepted by
both is .2. What is the probability that he is accepted by Dartmouth if he is
accepted by Harvard? Is the event ``accepted at Harvard'' independent of the
event ``accepted at Dartmouth''?

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(H)&=&0.3\\
P(D)&=&0.5\\
P(H\cap D)&=&0.2
\end{eqnarray*}
$$P(D\mid H)={P(H\cap D)\over P(H)}={0.2\over0.5}=0.4$$
$$P(H\cap D)=0.2\ne P(H)P(D)$$
