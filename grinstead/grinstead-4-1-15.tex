\section*{15.}
(a) What is the probability that your bridge partner has exactly two aces,
given that she has at least one ace?

\bigskip
\noindent
Probability of having exactly two aces.
$${{48\choose11}{4\choose2}\over{52\choose13}}=0.2135$$
Probability of having at least one ace.
$$1-{{48\choose13}\over{52\choose13}}=0.6962$$
The answer is
$${0.2135\over0.6962}=0.3067$$

\bigskip
\noindent
(b) What is the probability that your bridge partner has exactly two aces,
given that she has the ace of spades?

\bigskip
\noindent
Probability of having the ace of spades and one other ace.
$${{48\choose11}{1\choose1}{3\choose1}\over{52\choose13}}=0.1067$$
Probability of having the ace of spades.
$${{51\choose12}{1\choose1}\over{52\choose13}}=0.25$$
The answer is
$${0.1067\over0.25}=0.4268$$
