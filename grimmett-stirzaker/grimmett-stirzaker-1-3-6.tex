\section*{1.3.6}
You are given that at least one of the events $A_r$, $1\le r\le n$, is certain to occur,
but certainly no more that two occur.
If $P(A_r)=p$, and $P(A_r\cap A_s)=q$, $r\ne s$, show that $p\ge1/n$ and
$q\le2/n$.

Since no more than two events can occur we can ignore intersections of more than
two events. Hence
$$P(\cup_{r=1}^n A_r)=\sum_iP(A_i)-\sum_{i<j}P(A_i\cap A_j)=np-{1\over2}n(n-1)q$$
Since at least one event is certain to occur, we can write
$$np-{1\over2}n(n-1)q=1$$
For $q=0$ we obtain the minimum value of $p$, that is, $p=1/n$.
For $p=1$ we have
$$n-{1\over2}n(n-1)q=1$$
Solving for $q$ we get
$$q={2(n-1)\over n(n-1)}=2/n$$
Hence $p\ge1/n$ and $q<2/n$.
