\section*{1.8.39}
The $n$ passengers or a Bell-Air flight in an airplane with $n$
seats have been told their seat numbers.
They get on the plane one by one.
The first person sits in the wrong seat.
Subsequent passengers sit in their assigned seats whenever they find
them available, or otherwise in a randomly chosen empty seat.
What is the probability that the last passenger finds his seat free?

\bigskip
\noindent
Without loss of generality, we can assume that passenger $n$ is
assigned seat $n$.
For $n=5$, the following table shows all of the sequences that lead
to the last
passenger sitting in his assigned seat.
(For example, on the first line, the sequence is
passenger 1 takes seat 2, passenger 2 takes seat 1, etc.)

\bigskip
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Sequence & Probability \\
12 21 33 44 55 & $1/4\times1/4\times1\times1\times1=1/16$ \\
12 23 31 44 55 & $1/4\times1/4\times1/3\times1\times1=1/48$ \\
12 23 34 41 55 & $1/4\times1/4\times1/3\times1/2\times1=1/96$ \\
12 24 33 41 55 & $1/4\times1/4\times1\times1/2\times1=1/32$ \\
13 22 31 44 55 & $1/4\times1\times1/3\times1\times1=1/12$ \\
13 22 34 41 55 & $1/4\times1\times1/3\times1/2\times1=1/24$ \\
14 22 33 41 55 & $1/4\times1\times1\times1/2\times1=1/8$
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
\noindent
Adding up all the above probabilities we have
$$p={3\over8}$$
Let $P(n)$ be the probability that, given $n$ passengers and
$n$ seats, the last passenger sits in his assigned seat.
Since the first passenger has $n-1$ choices, we can write
$$P(n)={1\over n-1}K(n)$$
I could not derive this, but through trial and error, it appears that
$$K(n)={n-2\over2}$$
Hence
$$P(n)={n-2\over 2(n-1)}$$
