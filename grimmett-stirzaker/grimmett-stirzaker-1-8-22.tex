(a) What is the probability that this cherry contains a stone?

\bigskip
\noindent
We do not how many stones, if any, were removed.
Therefore the probability does not change.
$$p={20-15\over20}={1\over4}$$

\bigskip
\noindent
(b) Given that this cherry contains a stone, what is the probability
that the pig consumed at least one stone?

\bigskip
\noindent
The pig effectively sampled from 19 cherries, 4 with stones. Hence
$$p=1-(1-4/19)(1-4/18)(1-4/17)(1-4/16)(1-4/15)=0.7417$$
