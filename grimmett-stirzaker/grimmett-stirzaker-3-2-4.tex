\section*{3.2.4}
Three players, A, B, C, take turns to roll a die;
they do this in the order ABCABCA$\ldots$.

\bigskip
\noindent
(a) Show that the probability that, of the three players, A
is the first to throw a 6, B is the second and C the third,
is 216/1001.

\bigskip
\noindent
The probability that A rolls a six before B and C is
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(A)&=&{1\over6}+\left({5\over6}\right)^3{1\over6}
+\left({5\over6}\right)^6{1\over6}+\cdots
\\
&=&{1\over6}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left({5\over6}\right)^{3k}
\\
&=&{1\over6}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left({125\over216}\right)^k
\\
&=&{1\over6}\cdot{1\over1-{125\over216}}
\\
&=&{36\over91}
\end{eqnarray*}
The probability that B rolls a six after A and before C is
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(B\mid A)&=&{1\over6}+\left({5\over6}\right)^2{1\over6}
+\left({5\over6}\right)^4{1\over6}+\cdots
\\
&=&{1\over6}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left({5\over6}\right)^{2k}
\\
&=&{1\over6}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left({25\over36}\right)^k
\\
&=&{1\over6}\cdot{1\over1-{25\over36}}
\\
&=&{6\over11}
\end{eqnarray*}
Given that A and B have already rolled a six, the probability that C
rolls a six is 1.
Hence
$$P(ABC)=P(C\mid A\cap B)P(B\mid A)P(A)
=1\cdot\left({6\over11}\right)\left({36\over91}\right)
={216\over1001}$$

\bigskip
\noindent
(b) Show that the probability that the first six to appear is
thrown by A, the second 6 to appear is thrown by B, and the third
6 to appear is thrown by C, is 46656/753571.

\bigskip
\noindent
Player A has to roll a six before B or C so the probability is
$P(A)$ as in part (a).
After A rolls a six, B has to roll a six before A or C so the
probability is also $P(A)$.
After B rolls a six, C has to roll a six before A or B so the
probability is again the same as $P(A)$. Therefore 
$$P(A)=P(B\mid A)=P(C\mid A\cap B)={36\over91}$$
We have
$$P(ABC)=P(A)P(B\mid A)P(C\mid A\cap B)=\left({36\over91}\right)^3
={46656\over753571}$$
