\section*{1.3.2}
A fair coin is tossed repeatedly.
Show that, with probability one, a head turns up sooner or later.
Show similarly that any given finite sequence of heads and tails
occurs eventually with probability one.
Explain the connection with Murphy's Law.

\bigskip
\noindent
The probability of not tossing a head after $n$ tosses is
$$1-(1/2)^n$$
Hence
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}(1-(1/2)^n)=1$$
Let $p$ be the probability of tossing a sequence of length $k$.
Then
$$p={1\over2^k}<1$$
Hence
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}(1-p^n)=1$$
The fact that any sequence will occur eventually sounds like a
slightly weaker version of Murphy's Law ``anything that can go wrong will go wrong.''
