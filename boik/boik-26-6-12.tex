Suppose that $\bf A$ is pd.
Verify that all eigenvalues of ${\bf A}+{\bf A}^{-1}$ are greater
than or equal to 2.

\bigskip
\noindent
Since $\bf A$ is pd, by definition it is also symmetric.
Therefore by Theorem 9.3 it can be diagonalized as
$${\bf A}={\bf U}{\bf\Lambda}{\bf U'}$$
where $\bf\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of $\bf A$
and $\bf U$ is orthogonal.
We have
$${\bf A}+{\bf A}^{-1}={\bf U}{\bf\Lambda}{\bf U'}
+{\bf U}{\bf\Lambda}^{-1}{\bf U'}
={\bf U}({\bf\Lambda}+{\bf\Lambda}^{-1}){\bf U}'
$$
Note that if $\lambda$ is a diagonal element in $\bf\Lambda$,
then $\lambda+\lambda^{-1}$ is a diagonal element
in ${\bf\Lambda}+{\bf\Lambda}^{-1}$.
It follows that if $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $\bf A$ then
$\lambda+\lambda^{-1}$ is an eigenvalue of ${\bf A}+{\bf A}^{-1}$.
To find the minimum, take the derivative and set to zero.
$${d\over d\lambda}\left(\lambda+{1\over\lambda}\right)=
1-{1\over\lambda^2}=0$$
We only consider $\lambda>0$ because $\bf A$ is pd.
The minimum occurs at $\lambda=1$
therefore $\lambda+\lambda^{-1}=2$
is the smallest possible eigenvalue of ${\bf A}+{\bf A}^{-1}$.
Therefore all eigenvalues of ${\bf A}+{\bf A}^{-1}$ are greater
than or equal to 2.
