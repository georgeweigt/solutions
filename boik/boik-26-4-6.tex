\section{Section 25.4, problem 6}
Let $\bf X$ be an $n\times p$ matrix with rank $r\le p$ and let
$\bf\Omega$ be an $n\times n$ pd matrix.

\bigskip
\noindent
(a) Verify that if $({\bf X}'{\bf X})^{-{}}$ is a generalized inverse
of ${\bf X}'{\bf X}$, then $[({\bf X}'{\bf X})^{-{}}]'$ also is a
generalized inverse of ${\bf X}'{\bf X}$.

\bigskip
\noindent
Note that ${\bf X}'{\bf X}$ is symmetric.
$$({\bf X}'{\bf X})'={\bf X}'({\bf X}')'={\bf X}'{\bf X}$$
Then by Theorem 8.7 we have $[({\bf X}'{\bf X})^{-{}}]'$ is a
generalized inverse of ${\bf X}'{\bf X}$.

\bigskip
\noindent
(b) Verify that if $({\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X})^{-{}}$
is a generalized inverse of ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$,
then $[({\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X})^{-{}}]'$ also is a
generalized inverse of ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$.

\bigskip
\noindent
According to the ``Caution'' note on p. 74, the term positive
definite (pd) is applied
to symmetric matrices only, therefore $\bf\Omega$ is symmetric.
Since $\bf\Omega$ is pd, none of its eigenvalues are zero.
Therefore the inverse ${\bf\Omega}^{-1}$ exists and, since
$\bf\Omega$ is symmetric, ${\bf\Omega}^{-1}$ is symmetric as well.
It follows that ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$ is symmetric.
$$({\bf X}{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X})'=
{\bf X}'({\bf\Omega}^{-1})'({\bf X}')'={\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$$
Then by Theorem 8.7 we have
$[({\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X})^{-{}}]'$ is a
generalized inverse of ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$.
