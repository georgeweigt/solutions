\section{Section 25.6, problem 8}
Suppose that ${\bf A}\ge0$. Verify that ${\bf X}'{\bf AX}\ge0$.

\bigskip
\noindent
By Theorem 9.8, $\bf A$ can be factored as ${\bf A}={\bf TT}'$.
Then we have
$${\bf X}'{\bf AX}={\bf X}'{\bf TT}'{\bf X}=
({\bf T}'{\bf X})'({\bf T}'{\bf X})\ge0$$
where the last step (nnd) is by
Theorem 9.7 (b) on p. 74.
