\section*{26.4.4}
Let $\bf A$ be a $p\times q$ matrix and let $\bf g$ be a $p\times 1$
vector.
The linear equations ${\bf Aw}=\bf g$ are said to be consistent if
$\exists{\bf\delta}\ni{\bf A\delta}=\bf g$.
That is, the equations are consistent if a solution exists.
Denote the $p\times(q+1)$ matrix obtained by augmenting the matrix
$\bf A$ with $\bf g$ by $[{\bf A\, g}]$.
Show that the linear equations ${\bf Aw}=\bf g$ are consistent
iff
$$\mathop{\rm rank}([{\bf A\,g}])=\mathop{\rm rank}({\bf A})$$

\bigskip
\noindent
If the linear equations are consistent then $\bf g$ is
a linear combination of the columns in $\bf A$.
Therefore the augmented matrix has
the same rank as $\bf A$.
For the converse, if the augmented matrix has the same rank as
$\bf A$, then $\bf g$ is a linear combination of the columns in
$\bf A$. Therefore the linear equations are consistent.
