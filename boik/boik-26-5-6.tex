\section{Section 25.5, problem 6}
Let $\bf X$ be an $n\times p$ matrix with rank $r$ and let
$\bf\Omega$ be a pd matrix.

\bigskip
\noindent
(a) Verify that ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$ is diagonable.

\bigskip
\noindent
The first step is to show that ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$
is symmetric.
$$({\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X})'
={\bf X}'({\bf\Omega}^{-1})'({\bf X}')'
={\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}
$$
Since $\bf\Omega$ is pd we have that ${\bf\Omega}^{-1}$ exists
and that both ${\bf\Omega}$ and ${\bf\Omega}^{-1}$ are symmetric.
Now that we have established that
${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$
is symmetric, by Theorem 9.3 we have that
${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$
is diagonable.

\bigskip
\noindent
(b) Show how the diagonal form of ${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$
can be used to find the Moore-Penrose inverse of
${\bf X}'{\bf\Omega}^{-1}{\bf X}$.
