\section{Section 25.6, problem 7}
Suppose that ${\bf A}\ge 0$. Verify that $a_{ii}\ge0$ for all $i$.

\bigskip
\noindent
Since $\bf A$ is non-negative definite,
by Theorem 9.8 it can be factored as
$${\bf A}={\bf T}{\bf T}'$$
Let ${\bf t}_i'$ be the $i$th row of $\bf T$.
Then
$$a_{ii}={\bf t}_i'{\bf t}_i=|{\bf t}_i|^2\ge0$$
Therefore $a_{ii}\ge0$ for all $i$.
