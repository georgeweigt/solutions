\section*{20.}
The Polya urn model for contagion is as follows: We start with an urn which
contains one white ball and one black ball. At each second we choose a ball
at random from the urn and replace this ball and add one more of the color
chosen. Write a program to simulate this model, and see if you can make
any predictions about the proportion of white balls in the urn after a large
number of draws. Is there a tendency to have a large fraction of balls of the
same color in the long run?
