\section*{21.}
It is desired to find the probability that in a bridge deal each player receives an
ace. A student argues as follows. It does not matter where the first ace goes.
The second ace must go to one of the other three players and this occurs with
probability 3/4. Then the next must go to one of two, an event of probability
1/2, and finally the last ace must go to the player who does not have an ace.
This occurs with probability 1/4. The probability that all these events occur
is the product (3/4)(1/2)(1/4) = 3/32. Is this argument correct?

\bigskip
\noindent
No, but the result is close to the actual probability.

\bigskip
\noindent
Probability that the first player has exactly one ace.
$${{48\choose12}{4\choose1}\over{52\choose13}}=0.4388$$
Probability that the second player has exactly one ace.
$${{36\choose12}{3\choose1}\over{39\choose13}}=0.4623$$
Probability that the third player has exactly one ace.
$${{24\choose12}{2\choose1}\over{26\choose13}}=0.52$$
Therefore
$$p=(0.4388)(0.4623)(0.52)=0.1055$$
which is close to
$${3\over32}=0.0938$$
