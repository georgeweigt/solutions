\section*{19.}
In a poker hand, John has a very strong hand and bets 5 dollars. The probability
that Mary has a better hand is .04. If Mary had a better hand she
would raise with probability .9, but with a poorer hand she would only raise
with probability .1. If Mary raises, what is the probability that she has a
better hand than John does?

\bigskip
\noindent
Let $B$ be the event that Mary has a better hand and $R$ be the event that she
raises.
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(B)&=&0.04\\
P(R\mid B)&=&0.9\\
P(R\mid B^c)&=&0.1
\end{eqnarray*}
Compute $P(R)$ using total probability.
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(R)&=&P(R\mid B)P(B)+P(R\mid B^c)P(B^c)\\
&=&(0.9)(0.04)+(0.1)(0.96)\\
&=&0.132
\end{eqnarray*}
Next we have
$$P(B\cap R)=P(R\mid B)P(B)=(0.9)(0.04)=0.036$$
Therefore
$$P(B\mid R)={P(B\cap R)\over P(R)}={0.036\over0.132}=0.2727$$
