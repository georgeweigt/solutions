Using the Life Table for 1981 given in Appendix C, find the probability that a
male of age 60 in 1981 lives to age 80. Find the same probability for a female.

\bigskip
\noindent
The probability for a male is
$$P(80\mid60)={P(60\cap 80)\over P(60)}={36848\over81485}=0.4522$$
The probability for a female is
$$P(80\mid60)={P(60\cap 80)\over P(60)}={57062\over89835}=0.6352$$
